The Hanged Man is a Dragon Age fan collective built around creativity,
collaboration, and good‑faith conversation. If you’d like to join our community,
we’d love to have you — here’s what to know before you step inside.

## What You Can Expect

Our Discord server is the heart of our community. Inside, you’ll find:

- spaces for discussion, fanworks, meta, and events
- a mix of long‑time fans and newcomers
- adults who enjoy Dragon Age in all its dark‑fantasy glory
- a culture built on respect, creativity, and good‑faith interaction

## What We Ask of New Members

To help keep our spaces running smoothly, we ask that all members:

- read our [Code of Conduct](/community/code/)
- respect creators and their work
- engage in good faith
- tag content appropriately
- be adults (18+)

You don’t need to be a creator to join — just someone who enjoys fandom and
treats others with respect.

## Joining the Community

You can join us by entering the Discord server:

👉 [**Join The Hanged Man Discord**](https://discord.gg/9RERC6R) 👈

When you arrive, you’ll go through a short application process. This helps us
keep the community running smoothly and ensures that everyone who joins is a
real person and over 18.

You’ll be asked to:

- confirm your age
- share an active social media account (AO3, Tumblr, Bluesky, Dreamwidth, etc.)
- review and accept our rules

Once everything looks good, a moderator will approve your application and you’ll
be able to jump in and explore the server.

## A Note on AI Use

Members are welcome to use AI tools, but we do expect everyone to follow our
guidelines around respecting creative work. Please review our
[AI Use Policy](/community/code/#respect-for-creative-work--ai-use) before
participating.

## Events and Other Spaces

We also run fandom events, exchanges, and community projects throughout the
year. Some events have their own rules or content guidelines — check each event
page for details.

Participation in events is open to the wider fandom, not just Discord members.
