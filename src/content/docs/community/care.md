We want our spaces to be easy to navigate and comfortable for as many people as
possible. This page outlines the tools, practices, and expectations that help
our community function smoothly.

## Tagging and Content Warnings

We use tags to help people manage their own boundaries. Please:

- tag triggers and squicks when requested
- use spoiler tags for potentially triggering images (e.g., trypophobia
  patterns)
- label NSFW content clearly

If you need something tagged, just ask — we’re happy to accommodate.

## Managing Your Experience

You can tailor the server to your needs by:

- muting channels or categories
- adjusting notification settings
- using Discord’s built‑in accessibility features (font scaling, reduced motion,
  etc.)

If you’re unsure how to do something, feel free to ask.

## Reporting Issues

If something comes up:

- you can contact the moderators through ModMail or by tagging @Proprietors
- we’ll review the situation and respond based on our Code of Conduct
- we respect the privacy of anyone who reaches out

We don’t promise emotional comfort, but we do promise to address behavior that
violates our community standards.

## Respect for Creative Work

We expect all members to respect creators — fan, professional, and academic.  
Please review our
[AI Use Policy](/community/code/#respect-for-creative-work--ai-use) for details
on how AI tools may be used in our spaces.

## Events

Event pages include their own accessibility notes and content guidelines.  
If you’re unsure whether something is appropriate for an event, just ask a mod.

If you have accessibility needs we haven’t addressed here, you’re welcome to
reach out. We’re always open to improving how our spaces function.
