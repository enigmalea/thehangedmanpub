The Hanged Man is a community with its own rhythms, in‑jokes, and ways of doing
things. If you’re new, here’s a peek at what it’s like inside the tavern.

## Our Vibe

We’re an adult Dragon Age fan collective that enjoys:

- thoughtful discussion and deep‑dive meta
- fanworks of all kinds
- queer‑friendly, creator‑friendly conversation
- a mix of serious analysis and absolute nonsense\*

We’re not a fast‑scrolling meme server, but we’re also not solemn. Expect a
balance of brainrot, lore debates, and creative chaos.

<small>\* occasional unhinged keysmashing has been observed</small>

## How We Talk

- Long posts are normal.
- Lurking is welcome.
- Memes happen.
- Meta happens.
- Fic snippets happen.
- Good‑faith conversation is the norm.
- There is no such thing as necroposting.

You don’t have to be loud or constantly active to belong here.

## Community Culture

- We assume good intentions.
- We talk things out when misunderstandings happen.
- We respect boundaries and tagging requests.
- We value creators and their labor.
- We enjoy Dragon Age in all its messy, dark‑fantasy glory.

## Events and Activities

We host:

- fanwork exchanges
- themed events
- community projects
- occasional chaos nights

Participation is always optional.

If this sounds like your kind of tavern, you’ll fit right in.
