Our Question of the Day (QOTD) is a long‑running community tradition where we
share daily prompts for members to answer inside the Discord. Questions range
from writing and worldbuilding to Dragon Age lore, character development,
playlists, and lighthearted fandom fun.

After a hiatus, QOTD was relaunched with a new bot system programmed by our mod
Fox that makes posting and submitting questions much easier. Participation is
entirely optional, and members can jump in whenever inspiration strikes.

## What Gets Posted

Throughout the month, the bot posts a mix of:

- **Regular questions**
- **Multiple‑choice questions**
- **Monthly prompts**
- **Picrews / dollmakers**
- **Screenshot‑based prompts**
- **Caption This!** (add a funny caption to a shared screenshot)
- **Theme Day prompts**

Everything is posted directly inside Discord, and members can respond both in
Discord or on other social media if they're inspired.

## Monthly Prompts

On the first of each month, we post a prompt that can be used for writing, art,
playlists, screenshots, or any creative interpretation. Prompts may be a single
word, a phrase, an image, or another type of inspiration.

Members are welcome to share WIPs, finished pieces, or progress updates at any
point during the month (or after).

## Rotating Monthly Features

Once a month, the bot randomly selects and posts one of the following:

- **Picrew / Dollmaker Day**
- **Screenshot Day**
- **Caption This!**

These rotate so the community gets a variety of creative sparks throughout the
year.

## Theme Days

Instead of a single “Theme Week,” we now spread theme prompts throughout the
month. Some themes appear once per month, while others recur more frequently.

Current themes include:

- **WIP Wednesday** — every other Wednesday
- **Six Sentence / Six Minute Monday**
- **Monday Musings** (headcanons)
- **Turmoil Tuesday** (angst)
- **Thirsty Thursday** (smut & thirst)
- **Fic Rec Friday**
- **Soft Saturday**

Members are welcome to share their themed responses outside the server as well.

## Submitting Your Own Questions

Members can submit:

- regular questions
- multiple‑choice questions
- Caption This! screenshots
- monthly prompt ideas
- Picrews / dollmakers

…all **directly through the bot inside Discord**. No forms, no leaving the
server — just a quick `/qotd` command and you’re done.

We love seeing member‑submitted questions, and they help keep QOTD fresh,
varied, and community‑driven.
