The Hanged Man is built on the idea that fandom is better when people feel
welcome, supported, and free to create. These values shape how we interact with
one another and how we show up in the Dragon Age community.

## Everyone deserves space in the fandom

We welcome fans with all kinds of ships, headcanons, identities, and creative
preferences. You don't have to think like us to belong here—you just need to
treat others with respect.

## Creativity thrives when we support each other

Fanworks are the heart of our community. We celebrate all forms of creativity,
from fic and art to meta, playlists, edits, and everything in between.

## Adults can explore mature themes responsibly

Many of our spaces are 18+. We support adults' right to create and discuss NSFW,
dark, mature, or content others may find potentially sensitive or triggering
within platform guidelines, without politicizing, kinkshaming, or policing
fictional preferences.

## Boundaries matter

We expect members to use content warnings, spoiler tags, and other tools to help
others navigate safely. Respecting someone's boundaries is an act of care.

## Good faith goes a long way

Online communication can be messy. We try to assume good intentions, de-escalate
when needed, and talk through misunderstandings.

## People can grow

We believe in second chances. Past conflicts don't automatically define
someone's place here—what matters is current behavior and a willingness to
engage respectfully.

## Harassment has no place here

We do not tolerate call-outs, dogpiling, public shaming, or other forms of
harassment. These behaviors harm individuals and damage the fandom as a whole.
