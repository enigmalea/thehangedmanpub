The Hanged Man began on July 13, 2019, when our founder, enigmalea, created a
small Discord server as a place to talk about Dragon Age fanfiction—writing it,
reading it, betaing it, and celebrating the creativity of the fandom. What
started as a handful of channels and a simple idea quickly grew into a lively,
supportive space shaped by the people who joined it.

Over the years, our moderators and members have hosted events, launched
collaborative projects, and expanded onto other platforms. What began as a
casual fanfiction hangout has evolved into a welcoming hub for Dragon Age fans
who want to create, connect, and share their love of Thedas.

Today, The Hanged Man is growing into a **fan collective**—a community-driven
effort to make the Dragon Age fandom a more positive, creative, and connected
place. Whether you're here to participate in events, join discussions, or simply
enjoy the atmosphere, we're building a space where fans can gather, collaborate,
and feel at home.
