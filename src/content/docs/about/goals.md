The Hanged Man is a Dragon Age fan collective built around creativity,
connection, and community care. Our goals reflect the kind of fandom space we
want to nurture—one where fans can create freely, support one another, and find
a welcoming place to belong.

## Long-Term Goals

- **Create positive, meaningful spaces for fans to connect.**  
  We want our communities to feel warm, supportive, and open to a wide range of
  fan experiences—from casual conversation to deep-dive meta.

- **Encourage and celebrate fanworks.**  
  Fanfiction, fanart, edits, playlists, meta, and all forms of creative
  expression are central to who we are. We aim to host events and projects that
  keep the Dragon Age fandom inspired and engaged.

- **Support and uplift the wider Dragon Age fandom.**  
  We promote events, projects, and multi-fandom activities that resonate with
  Dragon Age fans, helping people discover new creators, communities, and
  opportunities.

## Short-Term Goals

- **Clarify and strengthen our collective identity.**  
  We're working to define the values and principles that guide The Hanged Man as
  a fan collective. Our mission is to create a shared foundation for current and
  future members who want to help shape our community.

- **Unify our projects under one umbrella.**  
  Many of our events and communities began as offshoots of the original Discord
  server. We want to bring them together so fans can easily find everything we
  do in one place, while still allowing each project (like DA Polyshipping and
  Arlathan eXchange) to maintain its own space and personality.

- **Build a consistent presence across social platforms.**  
  We've had accounts on Tumblr and other social media for years, and we're
  working to use them more actively. Our goal is to give fans who aren't on
  Discord a positive way to engage with the fandom and stay connected to our
  projects.
